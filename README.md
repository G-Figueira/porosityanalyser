ImageJ Porosity Analyser

Before using this macro, there are two key points to follow up:

1) Make sure that the all images have a consistent color pattern, e.g., the pores (or the phase to be analysed) must have similar gray level in all images.

2) Name the images accordingly, like this: sample_01_image_01.jpg; sample_01_image_02.jpg; sample_02_image_01.jpg, and so on.

You can use any image format supported by ImageJ.

Have fun!
